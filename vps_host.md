Need to run your bot 24/7? Get a cheap VPS.

Please be aware that by renting a VPS you get a barebones virtual Linux system. There is no user friendly graphical interface and everything will be done through command line. You will be expected to:

* Be able (or learn how) to connect to and navigate the system on your own
* Be willing to consult online resources on your own for any issue that arises
* Not rely on the help of our support for anything other than installing Red

## Windows hosting
(To be honest, you should probably just use a linux box.)
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/ - Microsoft-owned. Not on the cheap end, however.

## Others
[AWS Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/) - Amazon Web Services. Free for a year (with certain limits), but very pricey after that.<br>

[Lowendbox](http://lowendbox.com/) - A curator for lower specced servers.<br>

## Self-hosting
You can always self-host on your own hardware. A Raspberry Pi 2 B will be more than sufficient for small to medium sized bots.
For bigger bots, you can build your own server PC for usage, or buy a rack server.
Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.
